The NSQ cluster is ready to use. This cluster is made of :

* a NSQD replicaset
* a NSQLookupd replicaset
* a NSQAdmin replicaset

Your NSQD and NSQLookupd replicaset are exposed through [headless services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) by default. In this case, each instance of your replicasets will be exposed inside of the cluster through its own url :

* nsqd :
  {{ $nsqdFulName := include "nsq.nsqd.fullname" . }}
  {{ range $i, $e := until (atoi (printf "%d" (int64 .Values.nsqd.replicaCount))) -}}
  * {{ $nsqdFulName }}-{{ $i }}.{{ $nsqdFulName }}
  {{ end }}

* nsqlookupd :
  {{ $lookupdFullName := include "nsq.nsqlookupd.fullname" . }}
  {{ range $i, $e := until (atoi (printf "%d" (int64 .Values.nsqlookupd.replicaCount))) -}}
  * {{ $lookupdFullName }}-{{ $i }}.{{ $lookupdFullName }}
  {{ end }}

Finally, the NSQAdmin interface that allows you to monitor the topics/channels can be reached at {{ include "nsq.nsqadmin.fullname" . }}.
If you want to access it locally without exposing it, you can run `kubectl port-forward {{ include "nsq.nsqadmin.fullname" . }} 4171:4171` and reach `localhost:4171` from your browser.

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://nsq.io/overview/design.html) for further informations about the NSQ features and internals.
